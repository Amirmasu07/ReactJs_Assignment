                <p>Redux is a predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments, and are easy to test.</p>

                <p>While it’s mostly used as a state management tool with React, you can use it with any other JavaScript framework or library.It’s lightweight at 2KB(including dependencies), so you don’t have to worry about it making your application’s asset size bigger.</p>

                <p> With Redux, the state of your application is kept in a store, and each component can access any state that it needs from this store.</p>
